# SoundScapes
Sound loop project, completed 6/22/2019. Lets users choose from one of five looping nature sounds.

## Summary
This was created as an experiment with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was originally intended as a way to practice the skills learned from Wes Bos's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego&t=662s">drum kit projecct</a>, but it soon evolved into something very different.

As my skills increase, I'd like to go back and expand it to include more sounds, feature smoother UI/UX, and possibly be available as an app.

It currently features the following functions:
<ul>
  <li>Users can choose from one of five nature sounds by selecting the corresponding button.</li>
  <li>They can then switch between the sounds by selecting another button.</li>
  <li>The "stop" button will cut off all audio.</li>
  <li>The background will change according to the sound selected.</li>
  <li>Responsive for desktop computers, laptops, and mobile phones.</li>
</ul>

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Launch
Repository uploaded June 23, 2019.

May expand this project and launch it as an app/site with expanded capabilities.
